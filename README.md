**Author:** Aryan Kumbhare  
**Year:** 2025  
**Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, Plotly  

---

## Overview
Raksha Volt Simulator is a **virtual BMS platform** designed to **simulate, monitor, and visualize EV battery behavior** with safety-first logic.  
It provides a **software-only solution** for SOC estimation, safety validation, and fault visualization using synthetic battery data.

---

## Problem
EV BMS testing and training traditionally require **physical hardware**, which is **expensive, inaccessible, and hard to iterate** quickly.

---

## Solution
Raksha Volt allows engineers and students to:
- Simulate battery behavior without hardware  
- Estimate **State of Charge (SOC)**  
- Validate **BMS safety logic**  
- Visualize faults and battery performance in an **interactive dashboard**  

All in a **virtual environment**, reducing cost and increasing accessibility.
